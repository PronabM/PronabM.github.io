Respected Contact Person:

I'm writing to express my interest in the Web Development Engineer position. I have experience developing both webistes with and without using frameworks. While much of my experience has been in web developing, I understand other aiding skills such as Graphical Asset Creation and Software Coding Standards and SDLC. I know what it means to be an organized developer and look forward to prove my worth to your organization.

My responsibilities included the development and management of the site's editorial voice and style, the editorial calendar, and the daily content programming and production of the website.

I worked closely with healthcare professionals and medical editors to help them provide the best possible information to a consumer audience of patients. Also, I helped physicians learn to utilize their medical content to write user-friendly, readily comprehensible text.

Experience has taught me how to build strong relationships with all departments at an organization. I have the ability to work within a team as well as cross-team. I can work with web engineers to resolve technical issues and implement technical enhancements, work with the development department to implement design and functional enhancements, and monitor site statistics and conduct search engine optimization.

Thank you for your consideration.
